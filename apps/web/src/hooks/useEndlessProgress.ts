/**
 * Persistent Endless / Seasonal progress.
 *
 * The rules, as decided:
 *   • Quitting never costs progress — reopening resumes on the wave you left.
 *   • DYING drops you to the START of your current wave, not to wave 1. The stored
 *     wave is unchanged by a death; you just re-run that wave's rooms.
 *   • The board ranks WAVES COMPLETED, which is `wave - 1` and only ever goes up.
 *
 * `seasonId` partitions it: pass a season's id for the Seasonal Campaign (each
 * season starts everyone from scratch), omit it for Campaign Endless.
 *
 * The server owns the wave count — the client only ever says "I cleared the next
 * one" — so none of this is trusted from here.
