//
//  • 'magic'  — Valor's own embedded wallet, from email or Google. The only
//               path that MINTS an address, so it stays the sole owner of
//               player identity.
//  • 'wallet' — an external wallet the player already owned, connected either
//               through wagmi's injected connector or through Web3Auth's wallet
//               chooser. Both end at the same place; which one carried the
//               connection is an implementation detail, so they share a source.
//
// Magic wins if both are somehow live: it's the account the player's rank,
// items and G$ hang off.
