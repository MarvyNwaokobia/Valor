// The hard navigation (window.location, not router.push) is deliberate: it fully
// tears down the app so no authenticated page (Profile / Bank / Marketplace) is
// left mounted without a session. That half-torn-down state — the current page
// re-rendering with a null player right after logout — was what threw the
// "application error" when you signed out from anywhere but Home.
