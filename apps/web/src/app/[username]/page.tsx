/**
 * playvalor.app/<username> — the vanity permalink printed on every player card.
 *
 * The card image (and the card page footer) shows `playvalor.app/<username>`, so
 * anyone who screenshots a card and types what they see has to land somewhere.
 * Until this existed that URL 404'd, which made the line on the card a promise
 * the site did not keep.
 *
 * Resolves the name and redirects to the real card, carrying `?ref=` so a visitor
 * who arrives by typing the vanity link is attributed to that player exactly like
 * one who tapped a shared link (see middleware.ts).
 *
 * SAFETY OF A ROOT-LEVEL DYNAMIC SEGMENT: Next matches static routes first, so
 * /profile, /bank, /fight and friends are untouched — this only ever sees paths
 * nothing else claimed. Anything that cannot be a username (a filename, a wallet
 * address, the wrong length) is rejected before the lookup rather than turned
 * into an API call.
