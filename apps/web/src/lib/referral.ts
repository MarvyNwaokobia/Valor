'use client'

/**
 * Referral attribution, client side.
 *
 * Three layers, because no single one survives every path a shared link takes:
 *
 *   1. the `?ref=` in the URL            — right now, this tab
 *   2. a server-set cookie (middleware)  — survives ITP's 7-day cap on anything
 *                                          JS writes, and the Google sign-in
 *                                          round trip
 *   3. localStorage                      — covers the installed PWA, which has
 *                                          its own storage jar separate from
 *                                          Safari's
 *
 * None of them survive a click on a phone followed by a signup on a laptop.
 * That case is recovered by the "who invited you" field in onboarding, which is
 * pre-filled from whatever these layers found — the storage problem becomes a UI
 * problem, and the UI one is solvable.
