/**
 * Chunk-load resilience for the heavy game bundles.
 *
 * The 3D scenes (ValorScene / GameScene) ship as large dynamic chunks — three.js
 * + fiber + drei + postprocessing all land in one file. On weak / mobile networks
 * that single fetch can stall past webpack's chunk-load timeout, and after a
 * redeploy an old open tab can reference a chunk hash the CDN has since aged out.
 * Either way `next/dynamic` has no built-in retry, so one failed fetch used to
 * dead-end on Next's raw "Loading chunk NNNN failed" screen with no recovery.
 *
 * This wraps a dynamic import so it:
 *   1. retries the fetch a few times with backoff (rides out a transient stall),
 *   2. and if it still can't load a chunk, does a single hard reload — fresh HTML
 *      points at the current chunk names, which fixes the stale-deploy case.

 *   - a TIMEOUT failure (the request stalled) skips retries entirely and goes
 *     straight to a hard reload — re-attempting would just stall again;
 *   - any other chunk failure (typically a fast 404 from a stale deploy, or a
 *     transient blip) gets one quick retry, then a hard reload.
 * The reload returns a never-resolving promise so nothing renders mid-navigation.
 * Non-chunk errors are re-thrown for the boundary to handle.
