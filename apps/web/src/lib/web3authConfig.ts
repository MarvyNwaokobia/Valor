// Web3Auth is Valor's EXTERNAL-WALLET connector, and nothing else.
//
// Sign-in identity stays exactly where it was: Magic owns email and Google, and
// every wallet Valor mints is a Magic wallet. Web3Auth is here only to answer
// "I already have a wallet, let me connect it" — the path we used to serve with
// a self-hosted WalletConnect connector, which broke constantly because we owned
// the relay host, the cloud project, and the domain allowlist (see lib/wagmi.ts).
// Web3Auth runs all of that as managed infrastructure.
//
// Keeping it to wallets-only is the whole safety argument. Web3Auth's social
// logins would mint NEW embedded wallets, so the same person signing in with
// Google via Magic and via Web3Auth would end up holding two different
// addresses — which orphans their rank, items and G$, and is the exact pattern
// behind the GoodDollar one-face dedup that un-whitelisted ~44% of our wallets
// (see apps/api/migrations/add_magic_identity.sql). An external wallet has no
// such problem: the address belongs to the player already and we only ever read
// it. So the whole `auth` connector is switched off, leaving wallet discovery.
//
// This is one connector-level flag rather than a list of hidden login methods
// on purpose. Enumerating them means naming every provider the SDK supports,
// and the modal THROWS on a name it doesn't recognise ("Invalid auth
// connection: farcaster") — which aborts init and silently disables the connect
// button. Its accepted list also differs from the one the SDK exports and is
// not public (it lives in @web3auth/modal .../modal/src/ui/config.js), so any
// hardcoded list is a version-coupled trap. Switching the connector off needs
// no names at all.
