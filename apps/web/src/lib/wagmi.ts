// Primary login is Magic's embedded wallet, which deliberately does NOT go
// through a wagmi connector — it publishes its EIP-1193 provider to
// lib/walletBridge instead. wagmi's job here is only the separate "I already
// have a wallet" path.
//
// That path is `injected()` alone, on purpose. We used to also run a
// self-hosted `walletConnect()` connector, and every mobile connect bug we've
// had traced back to owning that integration: the pairing relay host getting
// sinkholed by consumer router/ISP resolvers (the endless "Connecting…" hang),
// the Reown Cloud domain allowlist rejecting pairings when `metadata.url`
// drifted, and relay-host pins that fixed our browser's leg while the wallet
// app still dialled the blocked host itself. None of it was ours to fix.
//
// `injected()` needs no relay, no cloud project, and no allowlist: it talks to
// a provider that is already in the page. Desktop extensions and in-wallet
// dApp browsers inject one; a plain mobile browser doesn't, so SignInModal
// deep-links those users into their wallet's own browser, where one exists.
// wagmi additionally auto-discovers named extensions via EIP-6963.
