      // `player` missing `wallet_address` made usePlayerSync throw on
      // `cachedPlayer.wallet_address.toLowerCase()` — in the effect body, which
      // React reports to the route error boundary as "Something broke". And
      // because the bad value is in localStorage, reloading rehydrates it and
      // throws again, so the retry button cannot clear it. That is the
      // intermittent, sticky crash.
      //
      // localStorage gets into that state without anyone doing anything wrong:
      // the persisted shape changes between releases while an old blob survives,
      // and iOS can kill a tab mid-write and leave a truncated record.
      //
      // `version` handles the honest schema bump; this validation handles
      // everything else, since a corrupt blob carries whatever version it was
      // written with. A cache is not worth a crash — anything that fails to
      // convince us is dropped, and the server sync refills it moments later.
