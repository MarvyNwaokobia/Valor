/**
 * @module GunStats
 * @description Weapon stat blocks for the ranged stat-duel.
 *
 * In the shooter pivot, a fighter's GUN — not their class — is the primary source
 * of combat power. The headless CombatSim resolver consumes these numbers to drive
 * fire cadence, projectile travel, hit chance and damage; class becomes flavour
 * layered on top (e.g. Phantom = longer dodge i-frames, Sentinel = more HP).
 *
 * Guns are class-AGNOSTIC: any fighter can equip any gun. The marketplace sells
 * them by tier, and the PvE Campaign (engine/campaign/levels.ts) gates progression
 * behind acquiring stronger tiers — that demand is the core economic loop.
 *
 * All numbers here are FIRST-PASS and meant to be tuned. `gunDps()` is the headline
 * "power" figure the marketplace sorts/level-gates on. Fire is travel-time, not
 * hitscan, so `projectileSpeed` is a real balance lever: slower rounds are more
 * dodgeable.
