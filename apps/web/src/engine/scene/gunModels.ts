 * The five real weapon models, one per gun tier, for the first-person viewmodel.
 * Same models the marketplace bakes (see dev/bake-items), so the gun you buy is
 * the gun you hold. The AR + Legendary are hand-authored GLBs; the Sidearm, SMG
 * and Marksman were generated (image -> SAM 3D). Enemies keep the shared rifle
 * (OperatorRig) — this is only the player's own weapon.
 *
 * Each model is normalised into the engine's weapon convention (barrel = +Z, up =
 * +Y, origin centred, a `muzzle` anchor at the barrel tip) so the scene can hang
 * any of them off the camera identically and swap on a weapon switch.

 * instead of a modelling pipeline.
