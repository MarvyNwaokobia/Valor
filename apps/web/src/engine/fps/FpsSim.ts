/**
 * @module fps/FpsSim
 * @description The headless first-person shooter core for the Valor clone (the plan
 * slice 1). Render-free and deterministic: no Three.js rendering, no DOM. The
 * scene passes the shooter's eye ray + input each step; the sim owns ammo,
 * cadence, reload, spread, the raycast against enemy hitboxes and cover, damage,
 * and respawns, and emits events the scene turns into muzzle flash, tracers,
 * hitmarkers and audio (audio arrives in slice 2).
 *
 * Reuses the existing gun catalogue (engine/combat/GunStats). The stat-duel's
 * hidden `accuracy` roll is reinterpreted here as an aim SPREAD cone: higher
 * accuracy = tighter cone. Skill (where you point) decides the hit now, not a die.
 *
 * The one deliberate split from the old CombatSim: RECOIL (the climb) lives in
 * the scene because it moves the camera, and the shot ray is simply the camera
 * forward the scene passes in. The sim owns only SPREAD (the bloom) on top of
 * that ray. So a shot goes exactly where the muzzle points, plus a little cone.

   * Wake whichever room the player is standing in.
   *
   * Dormancy is paced by the OBJECTIVE flow — breach wakes room 1, pushing to the
   * objective wakes room 2 — and that flow is a cursor that only advances when the
   * objective before it completes. So the wake for room 2 sat behind "clear room 1",
   * and you could walk past a live front room into the middle of five defenders who
   * would all keep facing the wall until you had killed everyone behind you. That is
   * not pacing, it is a room full of statues. Entering wakes a room now, whatever the
   * objective cursor thinks.
   *
   * "Inside a room" is derived from where its defenders were POSTED: get within
   * ROOM_ENTRY_REACH of any one post and that whole room turns to face you. Nothing
   * in the mission data describes room bounds, and inferring them from the walls
   * would mean guessing which of a dozen boxes is the divider — but a room IS its
   * defenders, and their posts trace its shape for free.
   *
   * A union of small discs, not one big circle around the room's centre. Several
   * authored rooms are long and thin (a hall, a cell row), and a circle wide enough
   * to cover one of those from its centroid also swallows the room next door — three
   * ops broke exactly that way. Hugging each post separately follows the shape
   * instead of bounding it.
   *
   * Read off `spawns`, not live positions, for a subtler reason: an awake room
   * maneuvers toward the player, so its enemies would drag their trigger discs along
   * behind you into the next room, and that room would never register as the one you
   * had walked into.
   *
   * Every room in reach wakes, not just the nearest: standing in a doorway is
   * standing in both, and the room you are stepping into is the one that most needs
   * to have noticed.
   *
   * This can only ever wake a room EARLIER than the objective flow would have, and
   * nothing here puts a room back to sleep — so pushing on through leaves the fight
   * behind you switched on, which is the point.
