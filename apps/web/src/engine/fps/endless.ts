/**
 * @module fps/endless
 * @description The endless room chain — the geometry behind Campaign Endless and
 * the Seasonal Campaign.
 *
 * A campaign Mission is a hand-authored compound with a fixed room count and an
 * objective list that ends in "extract". Endless is the same doorkicker gameplay
 * with no end: rooms are GENERATED one after another along -Z, the player pushes
 * forward forever, and the scene appends the next room's geometry while the player
 * is still fighting in the current one. Nothing ever remounts, so a run is one
 * continuous session (no mission list, no menu between waves).
 *
 * A WAVE is a batch of rooms. Batches grow: 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4 … so early waves are
 * quick hits and later ones are real pushes.
 *
 * Everything here is DETERMINISTIC from a seed. Two players given the same seed
 * walk the same compound in the same order, which is what makes a season fair:
 * nobody gets an easier draw than anyone else, and the server can replay a claimed
 * run's layout from the seed alone.
