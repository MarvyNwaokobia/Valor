 * Can this session actually produce an account to sign with?

 * "-32603 User denied account access", at the exact moment the player tries to
 * spend money. Asking the provider for an account is the cheap proof.
 *
 * RETRIED, because one failed call is not proof of a dead session. The provider
 * talks to an iframe that may not have booted on first paint, over a network
 * that may blip, on phones that throttle background frames. Treating any single
 * failure as fatal turned every transient hiccup into a forced sign-out — which
 * is exactly what players hit as an intermittent "Sign in to buy" on a session
 * they had never left.
