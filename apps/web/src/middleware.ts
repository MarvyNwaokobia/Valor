/**
 * Referral capture.
 *
 * Any request carrying `?ref=<wallet>` writes a first-party cookie, on ANY
 * route, so a shared card link attributes even if the visitor wanders off to the
 * landing page before signing up.
 *
 * Why a SERVER-set cookie rather than localStorage: Safari's ITP caps anything
 * JavaScript writes — localStorage and document.cookie alike — at 7 days, and
 * the slowest-converting visitors are exactly the ones who lose it. A cookie set
 * in the response is not subject to that cap. It also survives the Magic/Google
 * sign-in round trip, because the user returns to this same origin and the
 * cookie is still attached.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT httpOnly: onboarding is client-side and has to read this to
 * pre-fill the "who invited you" field. There is no secret here — a referrer
 * address is public, and the server re-validates it before paying anyone.
