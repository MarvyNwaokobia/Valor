-- Seasons prize pool + payout (B3 · closing the earn loop).
-- The `seasons` table already exists (id, name, starts_at, ends_at). B3 adds a G$
-- prize pool per season and a payout ledger. At season close an admin computes the
-- top Gauntlet runs within the season window, applies a top-heavy split, and
-- distributes G$ on-chain via the same ValorRewardPool rail as first-clear bounties
-- (idempotent per (season, wallet) ref). Run after add_gdollar_ledger.sql.

ALTER TABLE seasons ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS prize_pool_g  BIGINT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE seasons ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payout_status TEXT   NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending'
  CHECK (payout_status IN ('pending', 'paid'));

-- One row per winner per season = the computed prize and its on-chain settlement.
-- PRIMARY KEY (season_id, wallet) makes the whole payout idempotent: computing a
-- season's payouts twice is a no-op, and each on-chain transfer is further guarded
-- by the RewardPool's per-ref idempotency.
