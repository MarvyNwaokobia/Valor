-- Per-chain item pricing.
--
-- `items.price_g` is a single price per item, which was correct while Valor sold
-- goods on one chain. It is not any more: the same rifle costs 1,200 G$ on Celo and
-- 6,000 SCRP on Avalanche, and those are not conversions of each other. G$ has a real
-- exchange rate, so Celo prices track money. SCRP has none by design, so Avalanche
-- prices track TIME PLAYED — one campaign win is 100 SCRP, and every price is a
-- multiple of that.
--
-- THE INVARIANT THIS TABLE EXISTS TO KEEP
-- ---------------------------------------
-- A purchase signs an EIP-2612 permit for the price the SERVER quotes, then the
-- marketplace pulls the price the CONTRACT holds. If those disagree by even one wei
-- the transfer reverts, the player has spent a signature for nothing, and the error
-- surfaces as "the marketplace is broken". So the price here MUST equal the on-chain
-- listing for the same (item, chain).
--
-- Mirrored in contracts/script/RegisterAvalancheItems.s.sol. Change them together,
-- and verify with the on-chain read documented in that script.
--
-- WHY A TABLE AND NOT A `price_scrp` COLUMN
-- -----------------------------------------
-- A column per chain means a schema change per chain, and every query that prices an
-- item grows another CASE. A row per (item, chain) means adding a chain is inserting
-- rows. `items.price_g` is deliberately left alone: it stays the Celo price, so every
-- existing Celo query keeps working untouched.
