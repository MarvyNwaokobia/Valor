-- Seasonal weapons (2026-07-26)
--
-- Five weapons above the Valor Prototype, priced 3,000-10,000 G$. Each is a real
-- upgrade on it and each is better in a DIFFERENT way, so buying one is a choice of
-- playstyle rather than just a bigger number:
--
--   Ashfall Carbine   3,000  fast, accurate, forgiving — the entry seasonal
--   Warden's Repeater 4,500  heavy hitter, slow and deliberate
--   Rift Lance        6,500  energy marksman; huge per-shot, punishing to miss
--   Seraph            8,000  belt-fed LMG; 75-round mag, long reload
--   Ember Halo       10,000  the exotic; best at everything
--
-- The UUIDs are FIXED and mirrored in apps/web/src/lib/guns.ts (GUN_ITEM_ID) and in
-- the on-chain registration script. All three must agree or a purchased item won't
-- resolve to a gun in the fight.
--
-- ⚠️ `on_chain_id` values 29-33 must ALSO be registered on ValorItems +
-- ValorMarketplace before these can be bought — a purchase builds a permit against
-- the on-chain listing, so an unregistered item reverts. See
-- contracts/script/RegisterSeasonalWeapons.s.sol.
--
-- `sale_ends_at` is NULL for all of them = on sale indefinitely. Set it on the ones
-- that should close when the season does; the marketplace reads this column and an
-- item without one simply never expires.

ALTER TABLE items ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sale_ends_at TIMESTAMPTZ;

-- `weapon_stats` exists in the production database but NO migration ever created it: it
-- was applied by hand and never captured in a file. The INSERT below writes to it, so
-- against any database built purely from these migrations this file failed with
-- `column "weapon_stats" of relation "items" does not exist` — which means the migration
-- set could not rebuild prod's schema at all. That is the whole promise migrate.rs makes,
-- so the column is declared here, matching prod exactly (jsonb, nullable, no default).
-- No-op against prod, which already has it.
