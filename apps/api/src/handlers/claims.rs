//! The Bank's claim counter: turn accrued balance into on-chain currency.
//!
//! Celo pays the moment you win. This is the other shape, for Avalanche: a player
//! accrues Scrip as they play, sees a balance, and claims it when they choose. See
//! `migrations/add_earnings_and_claims.sql` for why that shape is better, and
//! `services/earnings.rs` for the invariant it has to hold.
//!
//! THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS IS THE WHOLE DESIGN
//! -------------------------------------------
//! Claiming and paying are separate steps, and they happen in this order:
//!
//!   1. refuse early if the relay cannot pay gas  — before touching any balance
//!   2. open a claim, attaching the unclaimed rows to it, in ONE transaction
//!   3. mint on-chain
//!   4. settle (success) or fail (release the rows back)
//!
//! Step 1 exists because steps 2-4 are recoverable but noisy: without it, a relay
//! out of AVAX would attach a player's whole balance to a claim, fail to mint, and
//! release it again on every single attempt. The player sees their balance blink
//! to zero and back with no explanation.
//!
//! Step 4's failure path is the one that matters. A claim that attaches earnings
//! and then fails without releasing them leaves the money gone from the balance and
//! absent from the wallet at the same time — invisible in both places.
