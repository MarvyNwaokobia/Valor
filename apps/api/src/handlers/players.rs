// Admin, MONEY-TOUCHING. Re-attempts every referral that never paid.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. `credit_referral` fires exactly once, inside the request that
// creates the referred player. If the chain call fails there — an empty pool, an
// RPC blip — the row is marked 'failed' and NOTHING ever looks at it again. That
// is how 18 referrals worth 9,000 G$ went unpaid for days: the pool was empty
// when they landed, and there was no second chance. Every other reward rail has
// a reconcile sweep; this one didn't.
//
// Pays the amount RECORDED ON THE ROW, not the current constant. The rate has
// been cut since these were earned (500 -> 200) and a player who was promised
// 500 is owed 500. The stored amount is the promise.
//
// Idempotent twice over: the on-chain `ref` is checked before spending gas, and
// the row is only marked 'paid' after a confirmed tx. Safe to re-run.
