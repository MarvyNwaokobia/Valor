//! Accrue-then-claim earning. The Avalanche edition's money path.
//!
//! Celo pays on the spot: win an op, the relay fires a transaction, real G$ lands.
//! That is untouched by this module and stays exactly as it is. Nothing here writes
//! to `g_ledger` or to any of the existing bounty tables.
//!
//! This is the other shape, for chains where Valor mints its own currency. A player
//! accrues, sees a balance, and claims when they choose. See the header of
//! `migrations/add_earnings_and_claims.sql` for why that shape is better.
//!
//! THE INVARIANT THIS MODULE EXISTS TO HOLD
//! ----------------------------------------
//! A unit of earned value is in exactly one of three states, and can never be in
//! two at once:
//!
//!   unclaimed  → counted in the balance, claimable
//!   claimed    → attached to a claim, NOT in the balance, awaiting or holding a payout
//!   released   → a claim failed, so it is unclaimed again
//!
//! The dangerous transition is the middle one. If a claim attaches rows and then the
//! on-chain send fails without releasing them, the player's money vanishes from their
//! balance while never arriving in their wallet. `fail_claim` is what prevents that,
//! and it is why claiming and paying are separate steps rather than one function.
