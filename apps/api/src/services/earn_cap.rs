//! Per-player weekly G$ ceiling, shared by every grindable earn surface.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS. Endless pays 100 × wave, repeatable for ever, which is the only
//! unbounded way to earn in the game — Campaign bounties pay once per level on first
//! clear, and rank-up bonuses pay once per rank. So one player with time can take an
//! arbitrary share of a finite pool. Observed: a median week is 750 G$ and the record
//! is 60,600.
//!
//! WHAT COUNTS. Only *grindable* earnings: Endless waves, Campaign first clears, and
//! rank-up bonuses. Season prizes and duel payouts are deliberately exempt — a prize
//! is budgeted, competitive and bounded by us already, and counting a 50,000 G$
//! season prize against the same allowance would consume a player's whole week for
//! winning something we chose to give them.
//!
//! NOT A HARD WALL. Past the cap, earnings continue at a reduced rate rather than
//! stopping. A hard stop means a player who caps on Tuesday has no reason to open the
//! app until Monday, which costs exactly the daily-active number the cap is meant to
//! protect the pool for. At 25%, earning another 25,000 past the cap takes 100,000 of
//! raw rewards — a real brake without a dead end.
//!
//! THE CAP IS NOT A SOLVENCY TOOL. It bounds one player, not the pool: at 50,000 a
//! handful of players can still empty a 200,000 G$ pool in a week. Keeping the pool
//! funded is a separate job (see `pool_warn_g` in the endless handler).
