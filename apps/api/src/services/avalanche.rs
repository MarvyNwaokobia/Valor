//! The Avalanche C-Chain relay.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT a second `ChainWriter`. That type is Celo-shaped all the way
//! down: it holds a non-optional G$ token, the GoodCollective rank pools, the
//! reward pool and the Endless pool. None of those exist on Avalanche, and
//! bending it to pretend they might would leave every call site checking which
//! chain it was really talking to. Two small honest types beat one type with a
//! chain-shaped hole in it.
//!
//! WHAT THIS WRITES
//!   • Match records — the same real fight already recorded on Celo, written to a
//!     second ledger. This is the transaction volume an Avalanche grant counts.
//!   • Scrip mints — when a player claims their accrued balance in the Bank.
//!
//! WHAT IT DOES NOT WRITE
//!   Anything involving G$. Every G$ payout stays on Celo, permanently, because
//!   Valor's GoodDollar grant requires rewards to be paid in G$ and G$ exists only
//!   on Celo and Fuse. See services::chain_id for the same rule stated once more.
//!
//! GAS IS AVAX, AND IT IS NOT FREE
//!   This was the cost of choosing C-Chain over a Valor L1: on an L1 we would mint
//!   the gas token and writes would be effectively free. Here every write spends
//!   real AVAX from the relay wallet. The relay running dry is already the single
//!   most common cause of failed payouts in this project's history, on a different
//!   chain, with a different token. It will happen here too if nobody watches the
//!   balance, so `relay_can_pay` exists for the same reason it does on Celo.
