//! Which chain a transaction landed on.
//!
//! Not to be confused with `services::chain`, which is the ethers client that
//! WRITES transactions. This module only names chains and their ids.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS AN ENUM AND NOT A BARE INTEGER
//! ------------------------------------------
//! `g_ledger.chain_id` defaults to Celo in SQL, which is correct for the ~731
//! rows that predate any second chain. But a default is a trap for new code: an
//! Avalanche payout whose call site forgot to pass a chain would silently record
//! as Celo, and nothing would ever surface it. Reporting would be quietly wrong
//! and the money would still have moved.
//!
//! So `insert_ledger_entry` takes a `ChainId` as a REQUIRED argument. The
//! compiler, not a code reviewer, is what stops that mistake. This codebase has
//! already been bitten once by a silent write failure (the 999 XP cap, swallowed
//! by `let _ =`), which is the argument for paying the small ergonomic cost here.
