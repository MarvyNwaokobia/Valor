//! Which edition of Valor a player belongs to, and whether it pays real money.
//!
//! Valor ships through two doors from one codebase (`apps/web/src/editions`): the
//! open web and MiniPay's in-app browser. They do not share an economy:
//!
//!   • web       — pays real G$, gated on the GoodDollar whitelist in onboarding
//!   • minipay   — pays NOTHING. No identity gate, precisely because nothing pays
//!                 out. Players spend real stablecoins in the shop; they never earn.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS A DATABASE COLUMN AND NOT A REQUEST HEADER
//! ------------------------------------------------------
//! The server cannot tell which edition a request came from. Every edition is served
//! from the same domain and origin on purpose, so existing players are never told to
//! go play the same game somewhere else. There is no header, key or origin that
//! distinguishes them that a browser could not also send.
//!
//! So the assertion is made once, at signup, and STORED. Every payout afterwards
//! reads the stored value. That converts a per-request lie into a one-time, sticky,
//! auditable choice, and it removes the dangerous direction entirely: a player who
//! signed up in MiniPay cannot later claim to be a web player to unlock earning.
//!
//! WHAT THIS DOES NOT DEFEND AGAINST
//! ---------------------------------
//! A client that lies AT SIGNUP, claiming `web` while running inside MiniPay. This
//! layer does not stop that, and it is important not to pretend otherwise. What
//! stops it is the GoodDollar whitelist that the web edition gates earning on: a
//! liar lands in the earning edition and then has to pass the same identity check as
//! everyone else. The edition column decides which rules apply; identity is what
//! makes the earning rules worth anything.
//!
//! The reverse lie — claiming `minipay` from a browser — costs the liar their own
//! earnings and gains them nothing, so it needs no defence.
