# Valor

A Web3 real-time 1v1 stat-duel SHOOTER built on [GoodDollar](https://gooddollar.org) + [Celo](https://celo.org). One verified human. One warrior. Forever.

Players verify their identity via GoodDollar, choose a character class, and enter a 3D arena where two fighters stand at range and trade shots. The only player skill is dodge timing — better guns mean more power. Gun economy drives the marketplace. Earn XP and rank up, buy guns/ammo/attachments from the on-chain marketplace using G$ — with no gas fees required.

## Smart Contracts (Celo Mainnet)

All contracts are UUPS upgradeable proxies, owned by the deployer EOA. Verified on Celoscan.

| Contract | Proxy Address | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `ValorItems` | `0x3ba09c51895Dacb90273A2A40C95369a5A1b4bFe` | ERC1155 NFT — one token type per item |
| `ValorMarketplace` | `0x95D167f569cf05C967C0432e3123baeac5D8d78D` | G$ purchases via permit relay; mints item NFTs |
| `ValorRewardPool` | `0x12a3f711A55f4dB0e9AF26C7429cc5018401F1f4` | Holds G$ for rank-up + daily claim rewards |
| `ValorGameRecord` | `0xd4ec6dB553E206cdf741448F94bD3B02D81c8571` | Immutable on-chain log of battles, rank-ups, character claims |

### Gasless Purchase Flow

Players never need CELO to buy items. The full flow:

1. **Frontend** reads the player's current G$ permit nonce on-chain
2. **Player signs** an EIP-2612 permit off-chain (no gas, no popup beyond signing)
3. **Frontend sends** `{ wallet, deadline, v, r, s }` to `POST /items/:id/purchase-relay`
4. **Backend** calls `ValorMarketplace.purchaseWithPermit(buyer, itemId, deadline, v, r, s)` — paying CELO gas from the relayer wallet
5. **Contract** pulls G$ from buyer via `permit` + `transferFrom`, then mints the ERC1155 item NFT to the buyer
6. **Backend** records inventory in the database and returns `{ tx_hash }`

---

## Game Mechanics

### Characters

Three classes with base stats plus ±3 wallet-seeded variance per player:

| Class | ATK | DEF | SPD | Special |
|-------|-----|-----|-----|---------|
| Berserker | 16 | 7 | 9 | Berserker Rage — 3× base damage |
| Sentinel | 9 | 16 | 7 | Iron Fortress — absorbs next hit, reflects 50% |
| Phantom | 12 | 7 | 15 | Shadow Strike — always first, bypasses defence |

One character per wallet. Class is permanent. Username is editable at any time.

### Combat — Stat-Duel Shooter

Two fighters at range trade shots in a 3D arena. Dodge timing is the player skill.

- **6 animation states**: idle, fire, stagger, dodge, death, victory
- **Projectile-based** (not hitscan) — travelling bullets that can be dodged
- **CombatSim** resolves: fire cadence from gun `fireRate`, accuracy roll, dodge i-frames, crit chance
- **Campaign**: 15 levels across 3 zones (Ashfall, Proving Ground, The Rift), bosses every 5th level
- **Endless mode** after level 15 with weekly leaderboards
- Bot fights: client runs CombatSim → server validates result
- Player challenges: fully server-side with a random seed
- Equipped guns determine fire rate, damage, accuracy; ammo/attachments modify stats; boosters 2× XP

### Ranks & XP

`Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Diamond`

| Event | XP |
|-------|----|
| Win | +50 to +104 (scales per campaign level) |
| Loss | +15 to +34 (scales per campaign level) |
| Rank threshold | 1,000 XP (exactly 15 wins at max level) |

XP resets to the remainder on rank-up. Rank-up triggers a G$ reward from `ValorRewardPool`.

### Decay

| Threshold | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| 48 h inactivity | Warning shown |
| 72 h inactivity | Rank downgraded |
| Reset by | Battle, mission collect, or daily check-in |
| Freeze | Equip a Shield item — pauses decay for 7 days |

### Items

#### Guns

| Gun | Price | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Standard Sidearm | Free | Starter weapon |
| Compact SMG | 150 G$ | Fast fire rate, low damage |
| Assault Rifle | 400 G$ | Balanced |
| Marksman Rifle | 900 G$ | High damage, slow fire rate |
| Valor Prototype | 2,000 G$ | Best-in-class stats |

#### Ammo Types

| Ammo | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Hollow Point | +20% DMG |
| Armor Piercing | +10% DMG, +5% crit |
| Tracer | +8% ACC, +30 RPM |
| Incendiary | 3 HP/s burn DOT |

#### Attachments

4 slots (barrel, optic, grip, magazine) x 2 options each = 8 attachments total.

#### Other Items

| Category | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Booster | 2x XP from battles while equipped (XP Booster, Elite Booster) |
| Shield | +DEF while equipped; can also freeze decay for 7 days |
| Legacy weapons | Iron Sword, Steel Blade, Void Edge — still exist from the melee era |

All 25 items are registered on-chain (`on_chain_id` 1-25). Purchased with G$ via the in-game marketplace. Items are ERC1155 NFTs on-chain, mirrored in the database for fast reads.

### GoodDollar Integration

- **Identity gate**: Players must be GoodDollar-verified humans to create a character (ERC-725 whitelist check via `@goodsdks/citizen-sdk`). A full-screen gate blocks all navigation until verification passes. The flow: wallet check → if already whitelisted, advance immediately; if not, an inline "Complete Verification" panel redirects to GoodDollar face verification in the same tab, with an "Already verified — continue" re-check button on return. A sign-out option is available throughout.
- **Daily G$ claim**: The in-app Daily Check-In triggers GoodDollar's UBI `ClaimSDK.claim()` directly — G$ flows from the GoodDollar protocol to the player's wallet. Gas top-up (if needed) and the claim itself are handled in two wallet prompts, surfaced with live step feedback in the UI.
- **Engagement Rewards**: Battle wins can earn additional G$ via the GoodDollar Engagement Rewards SDK (EIP-712 dual-signature: backend signs `AppClaim`, user signs `Claim`, frontend calls `nonContractAppClaim` on-chain). Requires portal approval — see *GoodDollar App Registration* below.
- **Marketplace**: All purchases use G$ on Celo — gasless via EIP-2612 permit relay
- **Rank rewards**: G$ distributed from `ValorRewardPool` on each rank-up

### Navigation

- **Home** (`/`) — character portrait + action cards
- **Fight** (`/battle`) — mode select: Campaign, Challenge a Player, Live PvP
- **Campaign** — CampaignSelect → `/fight?level=N` (3D combat arena)
- **Post-fight** — Retry (same level), Next Level (on win), Return Home

## Deployment

### Contracts

```bash
cd contracts

# 1. Deploy all four contracts
source .env
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol \
  --rpc-url $CELO_RPC_URL \
  --broadcast \
  --verify \
  --etherscan-api-key $CELOSCAN_API_KEY

# 2. Register items on-chain and list them in the marketplace
ITEMS_CONTRACT=<address> MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT=<address> \
  forge script script/Setup.s.sol --rpc-url $CELO_RPC_URL --broadcast

# 2b. Register new items (guns, ammo, attachments) after initial setup
ITEMS_CONTRACT=<address> MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT=<address> \
  forge script script/RegisterNewItems.s.sol --rpc-url $CELO_RPC_URL --broadcast

# 3. Copy proxy addresses into apps/web/.env.local and Railway env vars
```

### API (Railway)

The API deploys via the Railway GitHub integration using `apps/api/Dockerfile`. To force a rebuild from local source:

```bash
cd apps/api
railway up --detach
```

Required Railway env vars: `DATABASE_URL`, `BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GAME_RECORD_CONTRACT`, `MARKETPLACE_CONTRACT`, `CELO_RPC_URL`, `VALOR_APP_ADDRESS`, `DECAY_CRON_SECRET`.

After deploying to a fresh database, run the migrations in order:

```bash
railway variables --service Postgres --json   # get DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL
psql $DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL < migrations/init.sql               # 001 initial schema
psql $DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL < migrations/add_chain_tx_columns.sql  # 002 RLS + chain tx columns
psql $DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL < migrations/fix_decimal_columns.sql   # 003 fix decimal types
psql $DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL < migrations/add_gdollar_ledger.sql    # 004 G$ ledger + seasons
```

Planned migrations (not yet in `migrations/` — apply when implemented):

| # | Migration | Purpose |
|---|-----------|---------|
| 004 | guns | Gun items, fire rate, damage, accuracy columns |
| 005 | pve_level | Campaign level tracking per player |
| 006 | endless | Endless mode scores + weekly leaderboard |
| 007 | remove_melee | Drop legacy melee-specific columns |
| 008 | ammo_attachments | Ammo types + attachment slots |

### Frontend (Vercel)

Deploys automatically on push to `main`. Set all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars in the Vercel dashboard.

### GoodDollar App Registration

Valor is registered on the GoodDollar Engagement Rewards contract at `engagement-rewards.vercel.app`.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| App / Signer Address | `0x43a5BA0da132b21bdACfBc4392b72EeBaF6f2D82` |
| Reward Receiver | `0x12a3F1f4...` (ValorRewardPool) |
| User+Inviter % | 100% (all rewards flow to players) |
| User % | 70% (70% to battling player, 30% to their inviter) |
| Status | Pending approval |

Once approved, set `NEXT_PUBLIC_VALOR_APP_ADDRESS` (frontend) and `VALOR_BACKEND_SIGNER_KEY` (API) to the registered wallet. The `useValorEngagementRewards` hook and the `/rewards/sign-claim` backend endpoint are already wired — no code changes needed after approval.

---

## Known Limitations / Pre-launch TODOs

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Daily G$ UBI claim | Live | `ClaimSDK.claim()` wired in-app. Players claim GoodDollar UBI directly from the Daily Check-In button. |
| Engagement Rewards | Pending approval | App submitted at `engagement-rewards.vercel.app`. Once approved, battle-win G$ distributions go live automatically. |
| Identity gate | Live | Full-screen GoodDollar whitelist check. Already-whitelisted wallets pass instantly. Unverified wallets see an inline "Complete Verification" panel that redirects to GoodDollar face verification (same tab). Sign-out button available throughout. Nav is inaccessible until verified. |
| Ammo/attachment equip | Not wired | `Loadout.ts` has `resolveGunStats` but CombatSim doesn't call it yet — ammo/attachment bonuses are defined but not applied in combat. |
| Campaign level UX | Incomplete | No level context shown during fights — player doesn't see which level/zone they're in while fighting. |
| Per-level arena | Not implemented | All fights use the same stylized arena regardless of campaign zone. |
| GoodCollective rank pools | Not deployed | `RANK_POOL_*` env vars are placeholders. Deploy pools on `goodcollective.xyz` and grant `MANAGER_ROLE` to the backend signer to activate passive UBI drip for Silver+ ranks. |
| On-chain character claim | Deferred | `character_claim_tx` column exists and `ChainBadge` renders it, but character minting is not yet triggered in the onboarding flow. |
| Mission signature auth | Not implemented | `x-wallet` header is trusted without EIP-712 sign. Acceptable for MVP. |
| Inventory IDOR | Not implemented | Inventory endpoints don't require wallet signature. Acceptable for MVP. |
| RewardPool funding | Manual | Fund `ValorRewardPool` with G$ before rank-up rewards can be distributed. |
| GLB model assignment | Intentional | Sentinel class uses `phantom.glb`; Phantom class uses `sentinel.glb` — swap filenames in `CHARACTER_GLB` if this changes. |
