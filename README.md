# Valor

A Web3 **first-person tactical shooter** built on [GoodDollar](https://gooddollar.org) + [Celo](https://celo.org). One verified human. One warrior. Forever.

Players verify their identity via GoodDollar, pick a class + callsign, and drop into a solo campaign of first-person doorkicker operations — breach, clear, defend, rescue — across three theatres with escalating bosses. Every kill earns XP toward your rank; clearing an operation for the first time pays a one-time G$ bounty. An endless **Kill-House** and a ranked, seasonal **Gauntlet** feed a competitive economy where scarce G$ is earned from competition and spent on gear and survival — with no gas fees required.

**Live**: https://playvalor.app
**API**: https://valor-production.up.railway.app
**Contracts**: Celo Mainnet · [Celoscan](https://celoscan.io)

> The turn-based melee/stat-duel game Valor grew out of is preserved and fully playable at `/fight-legacy` — its engine code is untouched.

```

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| Frontend | Next.js 15 App Router, Tailwind, Framer Motion, Three.js / React Three Fiber (the FPS scene) |
| Auth | [Magic](https://magic.link) (email + Google → deterministic wallet), viem (no wagmi connector) |
| Backend | Rust, Actix-web 4, SQLx, Tokio |
| Database | PostgreSQL on [Railway](https://railway.com) (Hobby, same project as the API — direct connection, no pooler). Local dev uses a separate Supabase sandbox. |
| Hosting | Vercel (frontend) + Railway (API + Postgres, Docker) + GitHub Actions (decay/reconcile crons) |
| Chain | Celo Mainnet (chainId 42220) |
| Identity | GoodDollar Citizen SDK (ERC-725 whitelist) |
| Contracts | Foundry (Forge), OpenZeppelin UUPS upgradeable, ERC1155 + ERC677 |

> The stack briefly ran on Render + Neon (mid-2026) but consolidated back onto a single Railway Hobby project (API + Postgres) — see [docs/RAILWAY_MIGRATION.md](docs/RAILWAY_MIGRATION.md). Money + identity are all on-chain, so no funds were ever at risk during platform moves; `scripts/reconstruct-players.mjs` can rebuild off-chain rows from on-chain `ValorGameRecord` events if ever needed.

---

## Smart Contracts (Celo Mainnet)

All contracts are UUPS upgradeable proxies, owned by the deployer EOA. Verified on Celoscan.

| Contract | Proxy Address | Purpose |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| `ValorItems` | `0x3ba09c51895Dacb90273A2A40C95369a5A1b4bFe` | ERC1155 NFT — one token type per item |
| `ValorMarketplace` | `0x95D167f569cf05C967C0432e3123baeac5D8d78D` | G$ purchases via permit relay; mints item NFTs |
| `ValorRewardPool` | `0x12a3f711A55f4dB0e9AF26C7429cc5018401F1f4` | Holds G$; pays first-clear bounties + rank-up rewards + season payouts via `distributeReward(player, amount, ref)` (idempotent per `ref`, capped at `MAX_REWARD` 10,000 G$/call) |
| `ValorRewardPool` (Endless) | `0xd44D31645e3abBDc48a6Fc5E6E1bCd894db77Ba0` | Separate pool for Endless per-wave payouts (UUPS; fund + set `ENDLESS_REWARD_POOL_CONTRACT` to enable) |
| `ValorGameRecord` | `0xd4ec6dB553E206cdf741448F94bD3B02D81c8571` | Immutable on-chain log of battles, rank-ups, character claims |
| G$ SuperToken | `0x62B8B11039FcfE5aB0C56E502b1C372A3d2a9c7A` | GoodDollar token (ERC20 + EIP-2612 permit) |

### Gasless G$ flow (purchases, transfers, re-arm)

Players never need CELO. The pattern:

1. Frontend reads the player's current G$ permit nonce on-chain
2. Player **signs** an EIP-2612 permit off-chain (no gas)
3. Frontend sends `{ wallet, deadline, v, r, s }` to the backend relay
4. Backend submits the on-chain call, **paying CELO gas from the relayer wallet**, and records the result

Used for: marketplace `purchaseWithPermit`, player-to-player transfers (`permit` + `transferFrom`), and the Survival re-arm **session allowance** (one permit per run authorizes many instant re-arms). All signer transactions are serialized behind a nonce lock so concurrent writes can't collide.

### On-chain transaction surface

Valor writes to Celo mainnet constantly — every fight, rank-up, reward, purchase, transfer and re-arm is a real transaction. See **[docs/ONCHAIN_TRANSACTIONS.md](docs/ONCHAIN_TRANSACTIONS.md)** for the full catalog of what triggers a transaction, who pays gas, and the ideas for driving more on-chain volume.

## The Game (first-person build — live at `/fight`)

### Campaign

A solo, first-person doorkicker campaign: **15 operations across 3 zones** with a day → evening → night arc.

- **Ashfall** (warm day) → **Proving Ground** (golden evening) → **The Rift** (moonlit night, NVG earned)
- **Bosses** on op 5 / 10 / 15 — Cinder, the Warden, Valor — each escalating through 3 phases
- **Objective variety**, not 15 identical doorkickers: `reach` (breach/extract), `clear`, `defend` (hold a point while reinforcements trickle in), `rescue` (a hostage follows you out), plus a Rift **blackout** op (NVG jammed — fight by muzzle flash)
- **Weapons + loadout**: a 2-weapon loadout with per-weapon feel (sidearm / SMG / assault / marksman / legendary), fire modes (semi/burst/auto), swap
- **Attachments** (toggleable): NVG, laser, flashlight, optic
- Per-weapon fire audio + per-zone ambience; full VO presence lines; N8AO + set-dressing environment art

### Survival & the Gauntlet

- **Kill-House** (Survival) — an always-open practice arena of escalating waves. No stakes.
- **Gauntlet** — the ranked, prestige tier, **unlocked at campaign completion** (`pve_level >= 15`). A steeper curve, and its runs are **server-validated** (a run token + elapsed-time check reject impossible scores) onto the **seasonal leaderboard** that pays out G$.

### Ranks & XP (the progression loop)

`Iron → Bronze → Silver → Gold → Platinum → Emerald → Diamond` → **prestige** (Diamond I, II, III… uncapped).

Every kill earns XP (headshots worth more); the in-game rank bar reflects your **real server account** (seeded from `pve_level`/rank, not a local counter). The curve is **progressive**, not flat: each rank-up costs more than the last (`RANK_STEP_XP` = 400 / 900 / 1,300 / 2,500 / 4,500 / 8,000; every prestige past Diamond is a flat 8,000). Calibrated so Bronze lands in the first session and one full campaign clear (~2,610 XP) lands Gold.

Ranking up **does** pay G$, and it **grows** with the rank: the Nth rank-up pays `500 × N` (Bronze 500 → Silver 1,000 → … → Diamond 3,000), idempotent per `(wallet, rank)` on-chain and clamped to the 10,000 G$ per-call cap. Rank is also recorded on-chain (`recordRankUp`) and enrolls you in the rank pool.

### Character classes

Classes (**Berserker / Sentinel / Phantom**) are the player's chosen identity, set once at onboarding (permanent; callsign is editable). Their stat-duel special abilities live in the preserved legacy game at `/fight-legacy`.

---

## The Economy (earn loop)

**Principle: XP ≠ G$.** XP is infinite progression; G$ is scarce, earned from competition + spent in sinks.

| | Flow | Detail |
|---|------|--------|
| **In · first-clear bounty** (B0) | on-chain | Clearing a Campaign op the first time pays a one-time, capped G$ bounty (ordinary 2 G$; bosses op 5/10/15 pay 10/15/25). Idempotent in DB (`first_clear_bounties` PK) **and** on-chain (`ref` guard). A cron reconciles any failed payout. |
| **In · rank-up reward** | on-chain | Every rank-up pays `500 × ordinal` G$ (Bronze 500 … Diamond 3,000), from the RewardPool, idempotent per `(wallet, rank)`. |
| **In · Endless per-wave** | on-chain | Every Endless wave cleared pays G$ directly (banded `500 × ceil(wave/4)`: waves 1–4 → 500 each, 5–8 → 1,000 …). Server owns the wave count; a min-seconds-per-wave floor blocks machine-speed spam. Paid from the **Endless pool** (own contract, own ref guard). |
| **In · daily UBI** | GoodDollar | The Daily Check-In claims GoodDollar UBI (5 G$/day) straight from the protocol. (Valor's `/daily-claim` endpoint only records the cooldown; the UBI itself is a protocol tx.) |
| **In · season payout** (B3) | on-chain | At season close an admin computes the top Gauntlet runs in the window and distributes a top-heavy split of the prize pool via the RewardPool. |
| **Out · marketplace** (B1) | on-chain | Buy guns / ammo / attachments / cosmetics with G$, gasless via permit relay. |
| **Out · Survival re-arm** (B1) | on-chain | Mid-run **revive / resupply / wave-skip** for G$. One permit per run grants a spending cap (session allowance); re-arms are instant + non-custodial; spent G$ flows into the RewardPool (refilling the prize pool). *Disabled in the ranked Gauntlet — pure skill.* |

**Seasons** (`seasons` table + `prize_pool_g`): the Gauntlet leaderboard is the flagship metric; `GET /seasons/current` surfaces the live pool + each rank's estimated payout; the payout job settles winners on-chain at close.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- Rust 1.80+ (`rustup update stable`)
- Foundry (`curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash && foundryup`)
- PostgreSQL 15+ (or a Railway / Supabase project) + `psql`

### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarvyNwaokobia/Valor.git
cd Valor
npm install
```

### 2. Set up the API

```bash
cd apps/api
cp .env.example .env            # fill in DATABASE_URL, BACKEND_PRIVATE_KEY, contracts…
psql "$DATABASE_URL" < migrations/init.sql   # then the rest, in order (see Deployment)
cargo run                        # http://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Set up the frontend

```bash
cd apps/web
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # fill in NEXT_PUBLIC_* (Magic key, API URL, contracts…)
npm run dev                        # http://localhost:3000  (the FPS sandbox is /dev/verb)
```

### 4. Contracts (optional — mainnet contracts are already deployed)

```bash
cd contracts
forge build && forge test
```

### Tests / verification

- Web engine unit tests: `cd apps/web && npx vitest run src/engine`
- Runtime probes (Playwright vs a dev server): `apps/web/probe-*.mjs`
- API tests: `cd apps/api && cargo test`

---

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)

Auto-deploys on push to `main`. Set all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` in the Vercel dashboard. Custom domain **`playvalor.app`** is primary (`playvalor.vercel.app` 308-redirects to it). New domains must be added to the API's **`FRONTEND_ORIGIN`** (CORS, in the Railway env) and the **Magic allowlist** (origins + `/auth/callback`).

### API (Railway, Docker)

A Railway service (root directory `apps/api`) builds `apps/api/Dockerfile` and auto-deploys on push to `main`. Health check `/health`; the app binds `0.0.0.0:8080` and Railway auto-targets 8080 via the Dockerfile `EXPOSE`. Railway Hobby doesn't sleep, so there's no cold-start wait. The API and Postgres live in the **same Railway project** (`FRONTEND_ORIGIN` is the main env that changes per environment; `DATABASE_URL` is provided by the Postgres service). Public URL: `https://valor-production.up.railway.app`.

### Database (Railway Postgres) — bootstrap + migrations

Prod Postgres runs in the same Railway project as the API (direct connection, no pooler). Apply migrations in order via `scripts/bootstrap-neon.mjs` (name is historical — it works against any `DATABASE_URL`; run from repo root after `npm i pg --no-save`, with `DATABASE_URL` set to the Railway Postgres connection string):

```
init.sql → 004_guns → 005_pve_level → 006_endless → 007_remove_melee_items →
008_ammo_attachments → add_chain_tx_columns → fix_decimal_columns →
add_gdollar_ledger → add_first_clear_bounties → add_character_confirmed →
add_survival_rearms → add_survival_runs → add_season_payouts
```

`scripts/reconstruct-players.mjs` rebuilds `players` rows from on-chain `ValorGameRecord` events if off-chain data is ever lost.

### Crons (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/decay-cron.yml` runs every 3h, hitting `POST /decay/run` and `POST /battles/bounties/reconcile` with `x-cron-secret`. Requires repo secrets `API_URL` + `DECAY_CRON_SECRET`.

### Contracts

```bash
cd contracts && source .env
forge script script/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $CELO_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify --etherscan-api-key $CELOSCAN_API_KEY
forge script script/Setup.s.sol --rpc-url $CELO_RPC_URL --broadcast   # register + list items
forge script script/UpgradeRewardPool.s.sol --rpc-url $CELO_RPC_URL --broadcast --verify   # adds distributeReward
```

New items must be registered on-chain (`ValorItems` + `ValorMarketplace`) before they appear in the UI. Fund `ValorRewardPool` with G$ so bounties + payouts can pay.
